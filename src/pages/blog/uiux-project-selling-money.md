meta_description: A small test-case in designing the sale of money.
---
What started as a test page setup to try out some new interface components I was developing, turned into a sort of demonstration of humor. I fell asleep while working late on some of my projects when I had an unusual dream where I was freely printing money. It was a grand scheme that my dream “me” was rolling in cold cash from being able to sell the printing of money. It was as if I had a magical money printer that nobody else had!

As I awoke from this entertaining dreamscape, I quickly got to sketching out some of the fading memories I had and I ended up coming up with a small interface.

I then played around a bit more and turned it into a small test-case in designing the sale of money. Check it out, and be sure to try it out freely, as everything is functional but turned off, for obvious reasons(namely, having the Feds come to my door!).
